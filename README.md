## Bausbacher Family MLB Challenge

One year my family competed in a competition where each member of the family drafted MLB teams prior to the season starting. Teams were partitioned into four tiers based on the projected win totals from five-thirty-eight.com.

After the draft, we simply sat back and cheered for our teams. In an effort to enhance tracking of our season long competition, I developed this web app to display a live standings update, as well as an indepth look at each of our teams. 
This project coincided with an internship expierence in which I was learning PHP and Symfony, so it made sense to move put my learning to the test with this app. 

The app was deployed to Heroku during the season.
